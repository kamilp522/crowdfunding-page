# Frontend Mentor - Crowdfunding product page solution

It's the first time I've tackled with modules in js and got into more modular approach at all. In this project a lot of my
focus gone into learning how to structure my projects properly eg. using folders for components, different modules etc.
I hope to get better understanding of the subject as I'll build my future projects with more modular approach.

This is a solution to the [Crowdfunding product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
